Book Trading Web App

Hackathon project for Ellucian Summer R&D interns 2017. Only got 8 hrs so dont judge us. All the backend works reliably, just not all connected to the front end.

To run the app:

(We used firebase to host the mongodb database. Not sure if anyone wants to go through that trouble to see the app)

clone the repo, download and install nodejs, run npm install in the git directory, run npm start to run it.

The UI isn't beautiful and has some bugs. Some buttons dont work and the security is pretty trash. Sort of like a proof of concept.
